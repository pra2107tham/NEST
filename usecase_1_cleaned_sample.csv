Participants with one of the following two clinical presentations will be included: participants with evidence of de novo metastatic lung cancer or participants with evidence of de novo metastatic gastrointestinal cancer.

Participants may have undergone different levels of diagnostic workup prior to enrollment. Participants who have not had tissue biopsy performed prior to enrollment will be classified as 'basic workup' and those who have had tissue biopsy performed prior to enrollment will be classified as 'extended workup'.

During the diagnosis period, eligible participants will undergo liquid biopsy (FoundationOne® Liquid CDx assay; as per label) on blood samples. Blood samples will be tested using the FoundationOne® Liquid CDx assay at a central laboratory. In parallel, participants will undergo the standard of care diagnostic pathway, including tissue biopsy and histology workup, if not already done before enrollment, and molecular workup according to ESMO guidelines or national guidelines for each tumor type included in this study.

Treatment Protocol: Subjects are randomized into paclitaxel polymeric micelles for injection group and the Physician's Choice (TPC) group by the proportion of 1:1. Randomization is stratified according to three factors: number of lines of previous treatment for metastatic disease (2 or 3/4 lines), receptor status (triple-negative, non-triple-negative), and visceral metastasis (yes/no).

Progression-free survival (PFS) is the main efficacy indicator in this study. Treatment Group: Subjects are given paclitaxel polymeric micelles for injection, three weeks constitutes one cycle of treatment.

Control Group: Physician's Choice Group, subjects are given Eribulin Mesilate injection; or capecitabine tablets; or gemcitabine hydrochloride for injection; or vinorelbine tartrate injection; or paclitaxel (albumin-bound). Three or four weeks constitutes one cycle of treatment.

If subject does not develop disease progression after 6 cycles of dosing, the subject continues treatment until disease progression (RECIST 1.1) or develops an intolerable toxicity, initiation of a new anti-cancer drug, withdrawal from the study, death, or loss of follow-up.

Superiority design is used in this study, progression-free survival (PFS) is the main efficacy indicator. Assuming α = 0.0249(unilateral, adjusted test level), power=80%, the median PFS of the treatment group is 6.0 months, the median PFS of the control group is 3.7 months, the enrollment period is 12 months, and the study period is 24 months.

Participants without a documented relapse (hematological or extramedullary) or who did not die were censored at the time of their last bone marrow assessment or their last survival follow-up visit confirming remission.

Relapse free survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and the median observation time was calculated by the reverse Kaplan Meier method., Up to the data cut-off date of 10 October 2013; median observation time was 8.9 months.|Event-free Survival, Event-free survival was calculated from the start date of blinatumomab infusion until the date of bone marrow aspiration at which hematological relapse was first detected, or the date of diagnosis on which the hematological or extramedullary relapse was documented or the date of start of any new therapy for ALL (excluding HSCT), or the date of death, whichever was earlier. Participants who did not achieve complete remission or complete remission with partial hematological recovery during the core study were evaluated as having an event on Day 1. Participants in remission who did not experience hematological relapse, did not receive a new therapy for ALL (excluding HSCT), and did not die were censored on the date of the last available bone marrow aspiration or on the last date of survival follow-up visit, whichever was later.

Event free survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and the median observation time was calculated by the reverse Kaplan Meier method., Up to the data cut-off date of 10 October 2013; median observation time was 9.8 months.|Overall Survival, Overall survival was measured for all participants from the time the participant received the first treatment of blinatumomab until death due to any cause or the date of the last follow-up. Participants who did not die were censored on the last documented visit date or the date of the last phone contact when the patient was last known to have been alive.

The investigator used medical judgment to determine if there was a causal relationship (ie, related, unrelated) between an adverse event and blinatumomab.

An AE was considered ""serious"" if it resulted in death, was life-threatening, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption to conduct normal life functions, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect or is a medically important condition.

Progressive disease was not an adverse event, per the protocol, unless it was more severe than expected for the patient. Therefore, many deaths due to progressive disease were not counted as adverse events., From the start of the first infusion to 30 days after the end of the last infusion in the core study or from the start of the first retreatment cycle infusion to 30 days after the end of the last retreatment cycle, median treatment duration was 42.2 days.|100-Day Mortality After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant, The analysis of 100-day mortality after allogeneic HSCT was assessed for all participants who received an allogeneic HSCT while in remission (CR/CRh\*) following treatment with blinatumomab. 100-day mortality after allogeneic HSCT was calculated relative to the date of allogeneic HSCT.

Patients alive were censored on the last documented visit date or the date of the last phone contact when the patient was last known to have been alive.

The 100-day mortality rate after allogeneic HSCT was defined as the percentage of patients having died up to 100 days after allogeneic HSCT estimated using the estimated time to death in percent calculated by Kaplan-Meier methods., From the date of allogeneic HSCT until the data cut-off date of 10 October 2013; median observation time was 7.4 months.|Serum Blinatumomab Concentration at Steady State, The steady state concentration of blinatumomab was summarized as the observed concentrations collected at least 10 hours after the start of the IV infusion or dose step for cycle 1 and cycle 2, respectively.

NCT02366884,Clinical Evaluation of a New Form of Cancer Therapy (Atavistic Chemotherapy) Based on the Principles of Atavistic Metamorphosis (2011),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02366884,UNKNOWN,"The cell behavior that the investigators regard as ""malignant,"" including: cell autonomy; invasion and digestion of surrounding normal tissues; migration and colonization of distant organs; ability to develop resistance to drugs, temperature, or radiation; and ability to kill the host, are not only characteristics of cancer cells, but of pathogenic and/or opportunistic unicellular organisms (bacteria, fungi and protozoa). Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902), the father of modern pathology, first pointed out the resemblance between the biological behavior of cancer cells and that of single-celled organisms when causing infections. He thought, incorrectly, that cancer cells were cells infected with bacteria and had acquired their pathogenic behavior from them. Others later postulated that the behavior of cancer cells was likely due to the re-expression of past traits and behaviors (atavism) derived from their past evolutionary experience as independent, single-celled organisms from which all cells in multicellular organisms originated. In other words, the behavior of pathogenic unicellular organisms, including: unlimited replicative potential; capacity for invasion, migration, and metastases; abilities to evade the host's immune system, to generate multi-drug resistance; and to kill a host, are what the investigators define as ""cancer"" when one of the investigators cells re-express these past ancestral traits. This reversion or de-evolution of a differentiated cell to its ancestral undifferentiated, unicellular form has been named ""Atavistic Metamorphosis.""

This does not imply that cancer cells are bacteria, protozoa, or yeasts. It means that cancer cells express functions and/or behaviors similar to their ancestral parents, the unicellular organisms from which our cells originated.

If this is true, a combination of drugs that are effective to eradicate certain unicellular organisms may work in cancer treatment.

NCT06360211,A Study to Learn About How BAY2927088 Affects the Level of Midazolam in the Blood When Both Drugs Are Taken Together in Healthy Participants,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06360211,COMPLETED,"Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with specific genetic changes called Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutations.

Advanced NSCLC refers to a type of lung cancer that has spread from the lungs to nearby tissues or other body parts. People with advanced NSCLC may have changes in certain proteins like EGFR and HER2 that cause uncontrolled cell growth and increased spread of cancer.

In this study, participants will be healthy and will not benefit from taking the study treatment, BAY2927088. However, the study will provide information about how to test BAY2927088 in future studies on people with advanced NSCLC with EGFR or HER2 mutations.

BAY2927088 is under development for the treatment of advanced NSCLC with EGFR or HER2 mutations. It is expected to work against these changed proteins, which might slow down the spread of cancer.

Researchers think that BAY2927088 might affect an enzyme (called CYP3A4) that breaks down drugs in the body. This might make the effects of some drugs weaker or stronger. Midazolam is a drug that is broken down by CYP3A4. By studying the level of midazolam in the blood, researchers can understand how BAY2927088 might influence this enzyme's activity.

The main purpose of this study is to find out how BAY2927088, taken as a single dose and as multiple doses, affects the level of another drug, called midazolam, in the blood of healthy participants. To achieve this goal, researchers will measure the following for midazolam when participants take it with or without BAY2927088:

* Area under the curve (AUC): a measure of the total amount of midazolam in participants' blood over time
* Maximum observed concentration (Cmax): the highest amount of midazolam in participants' blood

The study will have 3 treatment periods:

Period 1 (Day 1 to Day 2): On Day 1, participants will take midazolam Period 2 (Day 3 to Day 4): On Day 3, participants will take midazolam with BAY2927088 Period 3 (Day 5 to Day 15): On Days 5 to 13, participants will take BAY2927088 On Day 14, participants will take midazolam with BAY2927088

Participants will be part of the study for about 8 weeks with at least 3 visits to the study clinic.

Participants will visit the study clinic:

* More than/at least once, within 2 to 28 days before the treatment starts
* Once on the day before the treatment starts and will stay in the clinic until Day 15 of the treatment
* Once, within 7 to 10 days after they finish treatment for a health checkup

During the study, the doctors and their study team will:

* do physical examinations
* collect blood samples from the participants to measure the blood levels of midazolam and of BAY2927088
* check participants' health by performing tests such as blood and urine tests, and checking heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)
* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having
