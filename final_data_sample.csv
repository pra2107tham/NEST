This study is about collecting information only. There will be no treatment in this study. This study will provide information on the trade-offs women are willing to make when deciding which treatment or treatments work best for them.

Women from Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (UK) will take part in this study.

Women will be recruited through a third-party recruitment company.

Most women will be asked to complete an online survey. Before the survey is sent to the women in the study, it will be tested by a small group of women. This group will be asked to take part in a telephone interview while taking the survey. They will be asked to say their thoughts aloud while completing the survey. Researchers will record this and also take notes. The aim of the interview is to check that the survey is understood by the women before it is sent out to the rest of the women.

The survey will have 3 sections: Firstly, the women will answer questions about their experience with menopause and their symptoms. Next, they will be shown pros and cons for specific treatments for their menopause symptoms. The women will be asked to choose which treatment they would prefer, based on this information.
