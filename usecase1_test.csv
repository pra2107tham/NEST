NCT01948791,16w Interventional Study on Titration and Dose/Efficacy Assessment of Exelon in Chinese Alzheimer's Disease Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01948791,INSTINCT,COMPLETED,To investigate the efficacy of Exelon capsule at maximal tolerated dose in mild to moderate Chinese AD patients via dosage titration from 3mg/d to 12mg/d in a 16 weeks duration,YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: ENA713,"Mean Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) was used to measure change in cognitive function. Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS) is a scale to measure specific cognitive and behavior disorders in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. The Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) provides a total score range 0-70, and consists of 11 items with lower score indicating lighter impairment and higher total scores indicating more impairment. A negative change score indicates improvement from baseline. Two-sided 95% CI of the difference in the means between baseline and post-baseline values were calculated., Baseline, Week 16","Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Score, ADCS-ADL is a scale based on caregiver's assessment of patient's activities of daily life. It is used in clinical studies on dementia \& consists of 23 items and is designed to assess patient's basic \& instrumental activities of daily life, such as the abilities necessary for personal care, communicating \& interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies \& interests, \& making judgments \& decisions. Response to each item is obtained by interview with the caregiver. The basic activities of daily life domain includes mandatory options for best response, or ""yes"" or ""no"" questions with separate sub-questions. Higher score \& more ""yes"" answers indicate better level of self-care of patient. Therefore the higher the total score is, the better the patient's functions. The total score is the sum of the scores of all the items \& sub-questions,\& ranges from 0 to 78. Two-sided 95% CI of the difference in the means between baseline and post-baseline values were calculated., Baseline, Week 16|Change From Baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), MMSE was used to determine patient's eligibility to participate, is an easy \& practical screening test to identify cognitive disorders. Test consists of 2 parts: language (time orientation, registration \& attention) \& performance (recall, response to written/verbal commands, writing ability \& reproduction of complex polygons); total score range: 0-30; higher score = better function. Positive change score = improvement from baseline. To meet eligibility criteria, patient's MMSE total score at screening had to be 10-26 (inclusive). Interpretation of MMSE by 4 methods: Single Cut0ff: \<24=abnormal; Range: \<21=Increased odds of dementia; \>25=Decreased odds of dementia; Education: 21- abnormal for 8th grade education, \<23=abnormal for high school education, \<24=abnormal for college education; Severity: 24-30=no cognitive impairment, 18-23=mild cognitive impairment, 0-17=severe cognitive impairment. 2-sided 95% CI of difference in means between baseline \& post-baseline values were calculated, Baseline, Week 16|Mean Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score, This scale assesses a larger scope of the behavior problems/disorders experienced in dementia patients, and identifies the frequency \& severity of the behavior disorders, \& allows rapid assessment using screening questions. 10 questions in behavior domain \& 2 in autonomic nervous system domain were assessed by the investigator interviewing with the caregiver. The NPI-12 total score is the total score of the 12 items, among which the score for each domain is the product of frequency (range: 1-4 points) and severity (range: 1-3 points). The highest score for each domain is 12 points and all the domains have the same weight. Therefore the range of NPI-12 total score is 0-144 points. The NPI-10 total score is the total score of the first 10 items 0-120, which constitute the original form of this scale. A higher NPI total score indicates more severe behavior disorder. Two-sided 95% CI of the difference in the means between baseline and post-baseline values were calculated., Baseline, Week 16|Change From Baseline in Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) Score, CBI, formulated by Novak and Guest in 1989, is a relatively complete and effective scale to measure caregiver burden that has been extensively adopted internationally. CBI has a total of 24 items in 5 domains, i.e., time dependency items (items 1-5), development items (items 6-10), physical health items (items 11-14), social relations items (items 15-18), and emotional heath items (items 19-24). Each item is scored on a 5-point scale based on the intensity of burden (0-4 points), so that the total score is 0-96, a higher score indicating heavier burden. It is a self-administered scale that takes about 10-15 minutes to complete.

NCT03823794,Trends in the Epidemiology and Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis in the United Kingdom (UK),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03823794,,UNKNOWN,"Atopic dermatitis, commonly called eczema, is one of the most frequently occurring skin conditions. It is estimated to affect around one fifth of children in developed countries and is also becoming increasingly common in less developed countries. Exact estimates of how common eczema is, vary considerably and there has not been an in-depth analysis of the number of people with eczema in the UK. It is also unclear which groups of people are most affected and which treatment options are being used.

Most people with eczema are managed by their general practitioner (GP) with only a few people requiring specialist care. GP records therefore provide an excellent opportunity to explore how common eczema is and which treatments are being used currently.

Their transformation into the sound range, and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to characterize sound patterns that correspond to specific problems or diseases can substantially enhance the physician's or other care giver's performance to the benefit of the patients.

A clinically relevant improvement will be demonstrated if the confidence interval for the mean change from baseline does not lie above the clinically relevant change of -1.35. If statistically significant results are obtained for the DPNP patients with MDD, then the same evaluation will be performed for the DPNP patients without MDD in another confirmatory analysis.

As secondary objectives the study will compare the two groups (MDD+/MDD-) regarding efficacy of duloxetine on BPI severity scales, the distribution of different percentages of pain reduction among the patient population, and the patients and physicians impressions of severity and improvement of pain.

The study will also compare treatment outcomes regarding patient-relevant functionality and quality of life (QoL) between the two groups (MDD+/MDD-) by evaluating each single BPI interference item, the Short Form 12 (SF-12) Health Questionnaire and the West Haven Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI).

As a third group of secondary objectives the efficacy of duloxetine of the psychological symptoms (e.g. depression) of DPNP patients with or without depression will be assessed using the Hamilton depression scale, the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.

Further the effect of duloxetine treatment on fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) will be evaluated.

To monitor safety and tolerability, treatment discontinuation rates, treatment emergent adverse events, change in vital signs, laboratory results and suicidal thoughts will be assessed.",YES,"Diabetic Neuropathies|Depressive Disorder, Major",DRUG: Duloxetine 60 mg QD|DRUG: Duloxetine 60 mg QD|DRUG: Duloxetine 30 mg QD|DRUG: Duloxetine 30 mg QD|DRUG: Duloxetine 90 mg QD|DRUG: Duloxetine 90 mg QD|DRUG: Duloxetine 60 mg QD|DRUG: Duloxetine 60 mg QD|DRUG: Duloxetine 120 mg QD|DRUG: Duloxetine 30 mg QD|DRUG: Duloxetine 30 mg QD|DRUG: Duloxetine 120 mg QD,"Change of Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Average Interference Score From Baseline to Week 12, The change from baseline reflects the week 12 value minus the baseline value.

The Peds-QL is a generic Health-Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) instrument designed specifically for a pediatric population. It captures the following domains: general health/activities, feelings/emotional, social functioning, school functioning. A 5-point score is used for each domain: from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0 so that higher scores indicate better quality of life (QoL). The total score is the mean (average) of all scores from the 4 domains. The change from baseline in total score is reported- a positive score indicates a better QoL compared to baseline and a negative score indicates a poorer QoL compared to baseline., Baseline and 6 months|Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL): Haemo-QoL, Change From Baseline in Total Score, The Haemo-QoL is a quality of life (QoL) assessment instrument for children and adolescents with haemophilia.

These patients will wear the Senti device. The first tranche will use the device over a single session lasting 20 minutes only. The second tranche (which will include patients from tranche one, and which will only proceed if no adverse events are detected in tranche one), participants will wear the device at their discretion (particularly encouraged to wear overnight) over the course of 5 days.

1. What is the feasibility of the Senti data-capture device?
2. Is this device usable in clinical practice?
3. What are the requirements to train patients to use the device?

4. Does the device function technically and practically, in real-world clinical scenarios?
5. What are the key expected and unexpected safety issues related to using the device (with a particular emphasis on whether the device is likely to cause pressure sores).

The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the study drugs. The study consists of 3 parts (Part 1A, Part 1B, and Part 2). The participant's standard of care ART regimen is continued throughout the study period.

MGD020 is a bispecific DART® molecule that binds CD3 and gp41 subunit of HIV-1 envelope. MGD014 is a bispecific DART® molecule that binds CD3 and gp120 subunit of HIV-1 envelope. These DART molecules redirect CD3+ T lymphocytes to kill HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells.

Part 1A evaluates groups of participants given a single dose of MGD020. A 2-week safety period is observed prior to escalation to the next dose level. Dose escalation continues until either the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) is determined.

Part 1B begins after the end of Part 1A. Part 1B evaluates groups of participants given a single dose of the MGD020 MTD or MAD from Part 1A and a fixed dose of of MGD014. The first group will be treated with a single dose of MGD020, at a dose determined to be one dose lower than the single-agent MTD/MAD from Part 1A, and a single 300 mcg/kg dose of MGD014. Dose escalation proceeds until either the MTD or MAD is determined.

Part 2 begins after the end of Part 1B. Part 2 is a multi-dose expansion group. Each participant will receive the MTD or MAD of MGD020 from Part 1B and a fixed dose of MGD014 from Part 1B, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 3 combination doses over 4 weeks.

This study will provide more information on a potential new treatment, called ASP0367. The main aim of the study is to learn how ASP0367 is processed by the body in these different groups of people.

This study will be in 2 parts. Part 2 will only happen if the results between the 2 groups are different in Part 1. In each part, people in the study will stay in a research unit for 6 days and 5 nights. Later, they will return to the research unit for 1 check-up.

In Part 1, people whose kidneys work normally and people whose kidneys work very poorly (severe renal impairment) can take part.

If Part 2 happens, people whose kidneys work normally and people whose kidneys do not work well (mild or moderate renal impairment) can take part.

In both parts of the study, people who can take part will be admitted to the research unit. The next day they will take tablets of ASP0367 just once. People will give blood and urine samples at various times during their stay. They will have their vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure) checked regularly. People will also have ECGs to check their heart rhythm. They will be asked if they have any medical problems. After 6 days, provided all the checks have been done and there are no medical problems, people in the study will leave the research unit.

People will return to the research unit for 1 check-up. This will be between 9 and 11 days after their last blood sample was taken during their previous stay in the unit.

NCT06148194,Efficacy of Probiotics (LiveSpo Navax) in Preventing Respiratory Diseases in Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06148194,,RECRUITING,"Acute respiratory infections are common diseases worldwide with the highest incidence and mortality rates, especially among children. Currently, the prevention of acute respiratory infections in children still faces certain limitations. Although there is a vaccine available for influenza, there are no vaccines yet for RSV and adenovirus in children, and influenza vaccination needs to be repeated annually to achieve optimal effectiveness. Therefore, maintaining respiratory and throat hygiene is essential for both treatment and prevention, ensuring respiratory health for children and reducing the risk of bacterial co-infections. In recent years, preventive strategies for respiratory inflammation have garnered increasing attention, with probiotics being shown to have the potential to support treatment and prevention \& reduce the risk of recurrent respiratory infections, thus decreasing reliance on antibiotics. Here, the investigators propose that direct nasal spraying of probiotics may be safe and effective in preventing respiratory diseases.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two types of nasal- praying Bacillus probiotics including LiveSpo Navax (1 billion/mL x 30 mL B. subtilis and B. clausii) and LiveSpo Navax Kid (0.6 billion/mL x 30 mL B. subtilis and B. clausii) in preventing respiratory diseases. Study Population: The sample size is 600. Description of Sites: The study is conducted at preschools in Son Tay Province, Hanoi, Vietnam.

Description of Study Intervention: A total of 600 eligible children are randomly divided into three groups (n = 200/group each). Children in the Control group received 0.9% NaCl physiological saline twice daily (morning and afternoon), with 2 sprays in each nostril and 2 sprays in the throat each time (totally 6 sprays each time), continuously for four weeks.

NCT00862082,Randomized Phase 1/2 Open-Label Trial of PR104 and Sorafenib in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00862082,,TERMINATED,"The current understanding of PR104 justifies the evaluation of PR104 with sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. These include:

* Hypoxia. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is likely to demonstrate a level of hypoxia sufficient to activate PR104 to its active metabolites PR104H and PR104M. In addition, in preclinical models, sorafenib has been demonstrated to increase the degree of hypoxia in tumors following treatment.
* Non-overlapping toxicity. PR104 and sorafenib do not share major toxicities. It is anticipated that both drugs can be administered at their full single agent dose when used in combination.
* Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3). HCC has been shown to express high levels of AKR1C3 which should lead to selective activation of PR104 within both hypoxic and oxic HCC cells.
* Preclinical data. The use of sorafenib and PR104 alone and in combination in a hepatocellular carcinoma model demonstrates activity of PR104 as a single agent and increased activity when PR104 and sorafenib are used in combination.

The current study will provide an estimate of the activity of PR104 in subjects with HCC. This information will prove valuable in defining the future clinical development of PR104, and in determining if PR104 has sufficient activity in HCC to warrant a larger phase III registration study in this indication.

Primary objectives

* Phase I: Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PR104 when used in combination with standard dose sorafenib
* Phase II: Estimate the response rate (RR) of PR104/sorafenib \[Note: Phase II was never initiated\]

Secondary objectives

* Evaluate survival
* Evaluate Progression Free Survival (PFS)
* Evaluate time to progression (TTP)
* Evaluate safety
* Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of sorafenib, PR104 and PR104 metabolites

The iADRS score ranges from 0 to 144 with lower scores indicating worse performance., Baseline up to Week 80","Change from Baseline in ADCS-iADL Score, The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item inventory developed as a rater-administered questionnaire to be answered by a participant's study partner, where a participant's performance level is rated over the last 4 weeks, based on a set of performance descriptions. The ADCS-iADL is a subset of the 23-item ADCS-ADL (items 6a and 7 to 23). The iADLs are more complex skills required to successfully live independently, and include shopping, keeping appointments, traveling outside of the home, making a meal or snack, and reading and writing. The iADL-items score ranges from 0 to 59 with lower scores indicating greater impairment., Baseline up to Week 80|Change from Baseline in ADAS-Cog13 Score, ADAS-Cog is a rater-administered instrument, designed to assess the severity of dysfunction in cognition, characteristic of persons with AD. The ADAS-Cog13, the cognitive subscale of the ADAS, consists of 13 items assessing cognitive function areas most typically impaired in AD: orientation, verbal memory, language, praxis, delayed free recall, and digit cancellation. The scores range from 0 to 85, with higher scores indicating a greater deficit of global cognition., Baseline up to Week 80|Change from Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), The CDR is obtained through semi-structured interviews of individuals with AD and informants. The ratings are obtained in six domains: memory, orientation, judgment \& problem-solving, community affairs, home \& hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a five-point scale of functioning as follows: 0 = no impairment; 0.5 = questionable impairment; 1 = mild impairment; 2 = moderate impairment; and 3 = severe impairment. CDR-SB score is obtained by summing each of the domain scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 18. Higher scores reflect greater cognitive and functional impairment., Baseline up to Week 80|Change from Baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), MMSE is a standard staging and assessment tool in AD, designed for grading the cognitive state of individuals with AD. The scale comprises tasks concerning orientation, memory, attention, language, and praxis to evaluate an individual's cognitive state. MMSE total score ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicative of greater cognitive impairment., Baseline up to Week 80|Change from Baseline in Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD), The QOL-AD tool is a 13-item assessment with each question scored on a 4-point scale where 1 = poor quality of life and 4 = excellent quality of life. Scores range from 13 to 52 with higher scores indicating better quality of life., Baseline up to Week 80|Change from Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) Score, NPI-Q is a validated questionnaire completed by informants about participants for whom they care. Each of the 12 NPI-Q domains contains a survey question (answered in Yes/No) that reflects the cardinal symptoms of that domain. If the domain response is ""Yes,"" the informant then rates the severity of the symptoms present within the last month on a 3-point scale and the distress of the symptom using a 5-point scale. The total NPI-Q severity score is the sum of the individual severity scores for each symptom and ranges from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating more severe behavioral impairment. The total NPI-Q distress score is the sum of the individual distress scores for each symptom and ranges from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater caregiver distress., Baseline up to Week 80|Change from Baseline in EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), EQ-5D-5L is a self-report survey that measures quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L consists of an EQ-5D descriptive system and EQ visual analog scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels, each assigned a unique 1-digit number: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The digits are combined into a 5-digit number that describes the participant's health state. The EQ VAS records the participant's health on a vertical visual analog scale, where the endpoints are labeled 0= the best health you can imagine, and 100= the worst health you can imagine., Baseline up to Week 80|Change from Baseline in Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD), The RUD questionnaire is a standardized tool and the most widely used instrument for resource use data collection in dementia, enabling comparison of costs of care across countries with differing health care provisions. It is designed to collect data on formal and informal care resource use and to be useful in different care settings, across different countries and care systems, and in both clinical studies and observational cost-of-illness studies., Baseline up to Week 80|Change from Baseline in Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), ZBI consists of 22 items. Twenty-one of the items are designed to measure several aspects of burden, whereas Item 22 is a global measure of burden. Response options for each item range from 0-4, and total scores range from 0-88, with higher scores indicating greater self-reported burden., Baseline up to Week 80|Effect of sabirnetug on Clinical Progression as Compared to Placebo Assessed Using Time Saved Analysis as Measured by iADRS, Baseline up to Week 80|Effect of sabirnetug on Clinical Progression as Compared to Placebo Assessed Using Time Saved Analysis as Measured by ADCS-iADL, Baseline up to Week 80|Effect of sabirnetug on Clinical Progression as Compared to Placebo Assessed Using Time Saved Analysis as Measured by ADAS-Cog13, Baseline up to Week 80|Effect of sabirnetug on Clinical Progression as Compared to Placebo Assessed Using Time Saved Analysis as Measured by CDR-SB, Baseline up to Week 80|Effect of sabirnetug on Clinical Progression as Compared to Placebo Assessed Using Time Saved Analysis as Measured by MMSE, Baseline up to Week 80|Percentage of Participants with No Clinical Progression at One Year, No clinical progression in participants will be defined as no decline in CDR-SB score. The CDR is obtained through semi-structured interviews of individuals with AD and informants. The ratings are obtained in six domains: memory, orientation, judgment \& problem-solving, community affairs, home \& hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a five-point scale of functioning as follows: 0 = no impairment; 0.5 = questionable impairment; 1 = mild impairment; 2 = moderate impairment; and 3 = severe impairment. CDR-SB score is obtained by summing each of the domain scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 18. Higher scores reflect greater cognitive and functional impairment., Baseline up to Week 80|Number of Participants with Treatment-Related Adverse Events (TEAEs), Baseline up to Week 80|Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), Baseline up to Week 80|Number of Participants who Discontinue or Withdraw due to TEAE, Baseline up to Week 80|Number of Participants with Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) and Neutralizing Antibodies, Baseline up to Week 80|Number of Participants with Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality with Edema/Effusions (ARIA-E) and ARIA with Hemorrhage/Hemosiderin Deposition (ARIA-H) as Measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Baseline up to Week 80|Number of Participants with Suicidal Ideation and Behavior as Measured by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), The C-SSRS includes 'yes' or 'no' responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe). Greater lethality or potential lethality of suicidal behaviors (endorsed on the behavior subscale) indicates increased risk., Baseline up to Week 80|Serum Concentration of sabirnetug, Pre-dose and multiple timepoints post dose up to 80 weeks|Concentration of sabirnetug in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), Up to Week 76|CSF Concentrations of ACU193 in a Subset of Participants, Up to Week 76|Correlation Between sabirnetug Exposure with Clinical Efficacy Measures, Correlation between sabirnetug exposure and clinical outcomes (including iADRS, CDR-SB, ADCS-iADL, ADAS-Cog13, and MMSE) will be assessed in this study., Baseline up to 80 weeks|Change From Baseline in Amyloid Plaque Load or Deposition Measured by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in Centiloids, Baseline up to Week 76|Change from Baseline in Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (vMRI) of Whole Brain Volume, Ventricular Volume, and Volume of Selected Regions of Interest, Baseline up to Week 76|Target Engagement Assessed by Measurement of sabirnetug- Amyloid-β oligomer (AβO) Complex in CSF, Up to Week 76|Change from Baseline in CSF Concentrations of Amyloid, Tau and Other Neurodegenerative Biomarkers, Baseline up to Week 76|Change from Baseline in CSF Concentrations of Amyloid, Tau, and Other Neurodegenerative Biomarkers in a Subset of Participants, Baseline up to Week 76|Change from Baseline in Blood Concentrations of Amyloid, Tau, and Other Neurodegenerative Biomarkers, Baseline up to Week 76|Correlation Between Change in Biomarker that Reflect Disease Progression and Clinical Changes, Assessment of the correlation between change in clinical outcomes (iADRS, CDR-SB, ADCS-iADL, ADAS-Cog13, and MMSE) and change in biomarker (amyloid PET) will be determined by computing Pearson's correlation coefficient for each treatment group., Up to 80 weeks",,Acumen Pharmaceuticals,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,540.0,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",ACU193-201|2023-509807-34-00,2024-02-29,2026-10,2026-10,2024-03-28,,2024-10-22,"The Neurology Center of Southern California - Carlsbad, Carlsbad, California, 92011-4219, United States|Neurology Center of North Orange County, Fullerton, California, 92835, United States|Irvine Medical Research, Irvine, California, 92614, United States|Healthy Brain Research, Long Beach, California, 90804, United States|Syrentis Clinical Research, Santa Ana, California, 92705, United States|CenExel - California Neuroscience Research Medical Group, Inc (CNR), Sherman Oaks, California, 91403-2131, United States|Yale School of Medicine - Alzheimer's Disease Research Unit (ADRU), New Haven, Connecticut, 06510-3330, United States|Research Center for Clinical Studies, LLC, Norwalk, Connecticut, 06851-4903, United States|Re:Cognition Health - Fairfax, Washington, District of Columbia, 22031, United States|JEM Research Institute, Atlantis, Florida, 33462, United States|Bradenton Research Center, Bradenton, Florida, 34205, United States|Gil Fernandez-Yera, MD, PA, Coral Gables, Florida, 33135, United States|Brain Matters Research, Delray Beach, Florida, 33445, United States|Coral Clinical Research, Homestead, Florida, 33032, United States|K2 Medical Research - Villages, Lady Lake, Florida, 32159, United States|Finlay Medical Research, Miami, Florida, 33126, United States|Collier Neurologic Specialists (CNS), L.L.C., Naples, Florida, 34105-8522, United States|Ocala Health - Family Care Specialists - Ocala I, Ocala, Florida, 34470, United States|Progressive Medical Research, Port Orange, Florida, 32127, United States|Alzheimer's Research and Treatment Center - Stuart, Stuart, Florida, 34997, United States|K2 Medical Research - Tampa, Tampa, Florida, 33607, United States|Charter Research - Lady Lake, The Villages, Florida, 32162, United States|Alzheimers Research and Treatment Center - Wellington, Wellington, Florida, 33414, United States|Conquest Research, Winter Park, Florida, 32789, United States|Charter Research - Winter Park, Winter Park, Florida, 32792, United States|Columbus Memory Center, Columbus, Georgia, 31909, United States|Accel Research- Neurostudies, Decatur, Georgia, 30030, United States|CenExel - iResearch Atlanta, Decatur, Georgia, 30030, United States|CenExel - iResearch Savannah, Savannah, Georgia, 31405, United States|Office of Jeffrey S.

NCT03511482,Integrated Digitally Enhanced Care for Long-term Conditions- Asthma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03511482,IDEAL,WITHDRAWN,"Asthma is a common lung condition that causes long term breathing difficulties. There is currently no cure for asthma but the use of simple inhaler treatments can keep the symptoms under control. If asthma symptoms get worse this can lead to an asthma attack which can be life-threatening. It has been shown that most of the deaths related to asthma are preventable if asthma is managed using the correct treatment plan however a significant proportion of patients are not using the right inhalers or not using them properly and do not know how to manage their asthma if it gets worse.

There is currently an unmet need to develop tools that can help improve asthma care, identify high risk patients, closely monitor their asthma control in 'real time' and intervene to optimise treatment to prevent asthma attacks. Both patients and indeed, the current British Thoracic Society (BTS) asthma guidelines recognise that technology has the potential to be used to improve asthma care and could lead to reductions in National Health Service (NHS) services use and improvements in symptoms.

Patients with better controlled asthma are less likely to be admitted to hospital and more likely to have an improved quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the delivery of an asthma service using an online doctor providing remote consultations paired with a self-management asthma app. The patients will use the app to input and track their symptoms, which will be monitored by a doctor remotely who can provide advice, optimise medications and intervene in a timely manner to prevent an asthma attack. The service is interactive, so the patient and doctor can communicate with one another 7 days a week by completing a consultation or sending messages via the online doctor portal or speaking on the telephone. The app will relay information about environmental triggers to the patient to help prevent the patient's asthma getting worse. The service will provide a new and potentially more convenient way of delivering routine appointments to reduce the numbers that do not attend. The patients will be able to watch educational videos stored on the app about asthma to potentially improve understanding of their condition. Digital training in inhaler technique will be supported with face to face support from pharmacists.

The goals are to increase adherence to and correct use of medication, help patients self-manage dynamically to reduce their risk of an asthma attack (with solutions personalised to an individual's triggers) and equip healthcare professionals with the data to identify those people at higher risk of an attack.

This is a before-and-after open interventional study, which means participants' asthma control will be compared before and after using the digital asthma management service. It is not a randomised study and participants will be given the choice of using a digital service. It is a single-centre study which will take place within one Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) in Hampshire (UK), across at least two GP surgeries. It is anticipated that approximately 80 patients will be recruited.

Patients will be provided with this digital asthma service for a period of 6 months of 2018 and outcomes will be measured using a combination of questionnaires (quality of life, patient satisfaction, level of activation) and quantitative measures such as Forced Expired Volume over 1 second (FEV1)(measure of airway obstruction), Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FENO) (measure of airway inflammation) and Asthma Control Test Scores (measure of symptom control). Feedback from NHS professionals hosting the study and online doctors will also be sought. A Health economic model will be generated comparing the digitally enhanced model versus usual care. The main outcome of this study is looking at whether this new model of service delivery can provide an improvement in asthma control test scores.",NO,Asthma,DEVICE: myAsthma Application|DEVICE: Lloyds Pharmacy Online Doctor,"Asthma Control Test (ACT), The ACT is a validated self administered questionnaire used to evaluate asthma control.ACT assesses the frequency of shortness of breath and general asthma symptoms, use of rescue medications, the effect of asthma on daily functioning, 12 months","Incidence of treatment emergent Adverse and Serious Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability, Safety assessed by the incidence of treatment pathway emergent adverse event (AE's) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE's) at study completion.

Validity has been assessed against an independent structured mental health professional interview.

The questionnaire can be delivered over the telephone., 12 month|General Anxiety Disorder (GAD7), The GAD-7 is a self-administered validated questionnaire and is used as a screening tool and severity measure for generalised anxiety disorder The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days', and 'nearly every day', respectively, and adding together the scores for the seven questions. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater. Using the threshold score of 10, the GAD-7 has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 82% for GAD. It is moderately good at screening three other common anxiety disorders - panic disorder (sensitivity 74%, specificity 81%), social anxiety disorder (sensitivity 72%, specificity 80%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (sensitivity 66%, specificity 81%)., 12 months|Problematic Experiences of Therapy (PETS), This is a validated questionnaire which measures difficulties experienced following the advice provided by an intervention.It has 4 domains which cover: 1) Whether symptoms themselves impede ability to follow advice, or are worsened by the advice, 2) Uncertainty about how to follow the advice, 3) Doubts about the efficacy of the app or online advice and 4) Practical obstacles to following the advice such as time or opportunity., 12 months|Self Efficacy for Appropriate Medication use Scale (SEAMS), Was developed by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in medication adherence and health literacy.

NCT03377231,Prevention and Treatment of Stretch Marks With Stratamark™,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03377231,,COMPLETED,"Stretch marks (striae distensae) are a form of scarring that is a natural result of pregnancy, obesity and in some instances occur due to puberty or steroid use. For some people, the stretch marks do not cause a problem, but in many circumstances they can cause physical symptoms such as itchiness, tenderness and pain. For many people stretch marks are also embarrassing and can have detrimental effects on a patient's mood and self-esteem. Stretch marks that result from pregnancy most commonly occur on the abdomen, breasts and thighs.

Topical silicone gel was developed nearly thirty years ago to be used in the treatment of widespread hypertrophic scars (abnormal scars, which may be red or raised/depressed itchy or painful). Since this time it has been used successfully on most scar types. . Since stretch marks are a form of scarring it is thought that topical silicone gel may be helpful for this scar type also. Stratamark™ has been developed using different forms of silicone polymers, in a gel format, that dries to form a very thin and flexible silicone gel sheet making it a convenient therapy for the treatment and prevention of stretch marks.

It consists of 2 parts: the first part assesses 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that have 3 possible levels of response (no problem, some problem, or extreme problem). These dimensions are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score. The EQ-5D United Kingdom (UK) score ranges from -0.59 to 1.0, where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health and negative values are valued as worse than dead. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) on which the participants rated their perceived health state on that day from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health).
