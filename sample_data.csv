1,2,NCT01948791,16w Interventional Study on Titration and Dose/Efficacy Assessment of Exelon in Chinese Alzheimer's Disease Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01948791,INSTINCT,COMPLETED,To investigate the efficacy of Exelon capsule at maximal tolerated dose in mild to moderate Chinese AD patients via dosage titration from 3mg/d to 12mg/d in a 16 weeks duration,YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: ENA713,"Mean Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) was used to measure change in cognitive function. Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS) is a scale to measure specific cognitive and behavior disorders in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. The Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) provides a total score range 0-70, and consists of 11 items with lower score indicating lighter impairment and higher total scores indicating more impairment. A negative change score indicates improvement from baseline. Two-sided 95% CI of the difference in the means between baseline and post-baseline values were calculated., Baseline, Week 16","Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Score, ADCS-ADL is a scale based on caregiver's assessment of patient's activities of daily life. It is used in clinical studies on dementia \& consists of 23 items and is designed to assess patient's basic \& instrumental activities of daily life, such as the abilities necessary for personal care, communicating \& interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies \& interests, \& making judgments \& decisions. Response to each item is obtained by interview with the caregiver. The basic activities of daily life domain includes mandatory options for best response, or ""yes"" or ""no"" questions with separate sub-questions. Higher score \& more ""yes"" answers indicate better level of self-care of patient. Therefore the higher the total score is, the better the patient's functions. The total score is the sum of the scores of all the items \& sub-questions,\& ranges from 0 to 78. Two-sided 95% CI of the difference in the means between baseline and post-baseline values were calculated., Baseline, Week 16|Change From Baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), MMSE was used to determine patient's eligibility to participate, is an easy \& practical screening test to identify cognitive disorders. Test consists of 2 parts: language (time orientation, registration \& attention) \& performance (recall, response to written/verbal commands, writing ability \& reproduction of complex polygons); total score range: 0-30; higher score = better function. Positive change score = improvement from baseline. To meet eligibility criteria, patient's MMSE total score at screening had to be 10-26 (inclusive). Interpretation of MMSE by 4 methods: Single Cut0ff: \<24=abnormal; Range: \<21=Increased odds of dementia; \>25=Decreased odds of dementia; Education: 21- abnormal for 8th grade education, \<23=abnormal for high school education, \<24=abnormal for college education; Severity: 24-30=no cognitive impairment, 18-23=mild cognitive impairment, 0-17=severe cognitive impairment. 2-sided 95% CI of difference in means between baseline \& post-baseline values were calculated, Baseline, Week 16|Mean Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score, This scale assesses a larger scope of the behavior problems/disorders experienced in dementia patients, and identifies the frequency \& severity of the behavior disorders, \& allows rapid assessment using screening questions. 10 questions in behavior domain \& 2 in autonomic nervous system domain were assessed by the investigator interviewing with the caregiver. The NPI-12 total score is the total score of the 12 items, among which the score for each domain is the product of frequency (range: 1-4 points) and severity (range: 1-3 points). The highest score for each domain is 12 points and all the domains have the same weight. Therefore the range of NPI-12 total score is 0-144 points. The NPI-10 total score is the total score of the first 10 items 0-120, which constitute the original form of this scale. A higher NPI total score indicates more severe behavior disorder. Two-sided 95% CI of the difference in the means between baseline and post-baseline values were calculated., Baseline, Week 16|Change From Baseline in Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) Score, CBI, formulated by Novak and Guest in 1989, is a relatively complete and effective scale to measure caregiver burden that has been extensively adopted internationally. CBI has a total of 24 items in 5 domains, i.e., time dependency items (items 1-5), development items (items 6-10), physical health items (items 11-14), social relations items (items 15-18), and emotional heath items (items 19-24). Each item is scored on a 5-point scale based on the intensity of burden (0-4 points), so that the total score is 0-96, a higher score indicating heavier burden. It is a self-administered scale that takes about 10-15 minutes to complete.

It is a generic measure, as opposed to one that targets a specific age, disease or treatment group. The lower the score the more disability; the higher the score the less disability. Norm-based scoring involving a linear T-score transformation method was used so that scores for each of the health domain scales and component summary measures have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 based on the 1998 US general population.

77,87,NCT03823794,Trends in the Epidemiology and Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis in the United Kingdom (UK),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03823794,,UNKNOWN,"Atopic dermatitis, commonly called eczema, is one of the most frequently occurring skin conditions. It is estimated to affect around one fifth of children in developed countries and is also becoming increasingly common in less developed countries. Exact estimates of how common eczema is, vary considerably and there has not been an in-depth analysis of the number of people with eczema in the UK. It is also unclear which groups of people are most affected and which treatment options are being used.

Most people with eczema are managed by their general practitioner (GP) with only a few people requiring specialist care. GP records therefore provide an excellent opportunity to explore how common eczema is and which treatments are being used currently. This study aims to provide accurate estimates of the number of people with current eczema (prevalence), number developing new onset eczema (incidence), and the pattern of common comorbidities in people with eczema. It also aims describe current treatment patterns by age groups and other factors.
